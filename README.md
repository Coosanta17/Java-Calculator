# Java Calculator
calculator written in Java to practice my Java skills and eventually (hopefully) make a useful, helpful calculator that can do things like graphing and graph summaries (intercepts and points of interent in an easy readable format rather than having to search through the graph), algebra calculations, complex numbers and other advanced (and simple) maths stuff.

Work in progress, don't expect much as of now.
